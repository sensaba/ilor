							<h3>Vastu guidelines for selecting the plot</h3>							
							Plots with irregular shapes must be avoided. Preference should be given to plots with a rectangular and square shape. 
							These are auspicious from the point of Vastu and are said to bring prosperity and happiness.
							<br>
							* Shapes to be avoided: Circular shape, oval shape plot, semi-circular shape plot
							<br><br>
							Below are generally referred as best Vastu compliant plots / sites.
							<br>
							# When the incoming road is from the east and hits the northeast part of the plot.
							<br>
							# When the incoming road is from the north and hits the northeast part of the plot.							
							<br>
							# When the incoming road is from the West and hits the North- West part of the plot.
							<br>
							# When the incoming road is from the South and hits the South- East part of the plot.
